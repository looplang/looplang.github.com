  <blockquote>
    where can I find the source code to loop?
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    on github at <a href="http://github.com/dhanji/loop">http://github.com/dhanji/loop</a>
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    what license is loop released under?
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    loop is open-source software, free to use in commercial or personal projects and
    is released under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/MIT">mit license</a>.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    what is loop's type system like? (strong, static, etc.)
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    loop is dynamic, strong and duck typed. in other words,
    it enforces strong type safety over expressions and functions, and these are resolved
    at runtime.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    is loop also value-typed?
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    yes. objects are equal if their structure and data are "deeply" equal.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    is loop capable of multi-threading/concurrency?
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    yes, using a combination of features called <i>message-driven
    channels</i> and <i>software transactional memory</i>.
    in fact much of loop is designed around high performance and concurrency.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    does loop optimize tail calls (tco)?
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    yes, but currently loop only optimizes <i>recursive</i> tail calls.
